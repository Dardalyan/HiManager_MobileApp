```
   My new and the latest project, mobile application named HiManager.
   
   This Project is developped in React Native using TypeScript & JavaScript.
   
   This application uses my latest REST Api project named HiManager (developped in .NetCore 7). You can find that project in my repositories as well.
   
   In the GIF files I have shared below, you can see the pages and operations in my application.
